.. _animated-waves-section:

Animated Waves
--------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Animated Waves simulation contains the animated surface shape.
This typically contains the ocean waves (see the Wave conditions section below), but can be modified as required.
For example, parts of the water can be pushed down below geometry if required.

The animated waves sim can be configured by assigning an Animated Waves Sim Settings asset to the OceanRenderer script in your scene (:menuselection:`Create --> Crest --> Animated Wave Sim Settings`).

The waves will be dampened/attenuated in shallow water if a *Sea Floor Depth* LOD data is used (see :ref:`sea-floor-depth-section`).
The amount that waves are attenuated is configurable using the *Attenuation In Shallows* setting.

User Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Preview

   Splines now support animated waves. Please see :ref:`wave-splines-section` for general spline information.

To add some shape, add some geometry into the world which when rendered from a top down perspective will draw the desired displacements.
Then assign the *Register Anim Waves Input* script which will tag it for rendering into the shape.
This is demonstrated in :numref:`adding-inputs-video`

There is an example in the *boat.unity* scene, GameObject *wp0*, where a smoothstep bump is added to the water shape.
This is an efficient way to generate dynamic shape.
This renders with additive blend, but other blending modes are possible such as alpha blend, multiplicative blending, and min or max blending, which give powerful control over the shape.

The following input shaders are provided under *Crest/Inputs/Animated Waves*:

-  **Add From Texture** allows any kind of shape added to the surface from a texture.
   Can ether be a heightmap texture (1 channel) or a 3 channel XYZ displacement texture.
   Optionally the alpha channel can be used to write to subsurface scattering which increases the amount of light emitted from the water volume, which is useful for approximating light scattering.
-  **Set Base Water Height Using Geometry** allows the sea level (average water height) to be offset some amount.
   The top surface of the geometry will provide the water height, and the waves will apply on top.
-  **Push Water Under Convex Hull** pushes the water underneath the geometry.
   Can be used to define a volume of space which should stay 'dry'.
-  **Set Water Height Using Geometry** snaps the water surface to the top surface of the geometry.
   Will override any waves.
-  **Wave Particle** is a 'bump' of water.
   Many bumps can be combined to make interesting effects such as wakes for boats or choppy water.

.. _dynamic-waves-section:

Dynamic Waves
-------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Crest includes a multi-resolution dynamic wave simulation, which allows objects like boats to interact with the water.

To turn on this feature, enable the *Create Dynamic Wave Sim* option on the *OceanRenderer* script, and to configure the sim, create or assign a *Dynamic Wave Sim Settings* asset on the *Sim Settings Dynamic Waves* option.

One use case for this is boat wakes.
In the *boat.unity* scene, the geometry and shader on the *WaterObjectInteractionSphere0* GameObject will apply forces to the water.
It has the *RegisterDynWavesInput* component attached to register it with the system.

The dynamic wave simulation is added on top of the animated Gerstner waves to give the final shape.


.. _dynamic_waves_settings:

Simulation Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the settings below refer to the *Dynamic Wave Sim Settings* asset.

-  **Simulation Frequency** - Frequency to run the dynamic wave sim, in updates per second.
   Lower frequencies can be more efficient but may limit wave speed or lead to visible jitter.
   Default is 60 updates per second.

-  **Damping** - How much energy is dissipated each frame.
   Helps sim stability, but limits how far ripples will propagate.
   Set this as large as possible/acceptable.
   Default is 0.05.

-  **Courant Number** - Stability control.
   Lower values means more stable sim, but may slow down some dynamic waves.
   This value should be set as large as possible until sim instabilities/flickering begin to appear.
   Default is 0.7.

-  **Horiz Displace** - Induce horizontal displacements to sharpen simulated waves.

-  **Displace Clamp** - Clamp displacement to help prevent self-intersection in steep waves.
   Zero means unclamped.

-  **Gravity Multiplier** - Multiplier for gravity.
   More gravity means dynamic waves will travel faster.

The *OceanDebugGUI* script gives the debug overlay in the example content scenes and reports the number of sim steps taken each frame.


User Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^

User provided contributions can be rendered into this simulation to create dynamic wave effects.
An example can be found in the boat prefab.
Each LOD sim runs independently and it is desirable to add interaction forces into all appropriate sims.
The *ObjectWaterInteraction* script takes into account the boat size and counts how many sims are appropriate, and then weights the interaction forces based on this number, so the force is spread evenly to all sims.
As noted above, the sim results will be copied into the dynamic waves LODs and then accumulated up the LOD chain to reconstruct a single simulation.

The following input shaders are provided under *Crest/Inputs/Dynamic Waves*:

-  **Add Bump** adds a round force to pull the surface up (or push it down).
   This can be moved around to create interesting effects.

-  **Object Interaction** can be used in conjunction with the *ObjectWaterInteraction* script to simulate the interaction of an object with the water.
   Can be used for boat wakes.
   See the boat example scenes.

-  **Sphere-Water Interaction** is a more specialized and accurate version of the *Object Interaction* input.
   It models the interaction between a sphere and takes into account how submerged the sphere is.
   Multiple spheres can be composed into compound shapes.
   See the *Spinner* object in the *boat.unity* example scene for an example.


.. _foam-section:

Foam
----

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Crest simulates foam getting generated by choppy water (*pinched*) wave crests) and in shallow water to approximate foam from splashes at shoreline.
Each update (default is 30 updates per second), the foam values are reduced to model gradual dissipation of foam over time.

To turn on this feature, enable the *Create Foam Sim* option on the *OceanRenderer* script, and ensure the *Enable* option is ticked in the Foam group on the ocean material.

To configure the foam sim, create a *Foam Sim Settings* asset by right clicking the a folder in the *Project* window and selecting *Create/Crest/Foam Sim Settings*, and assigning it to the OceanRenderer component in your scene.


User Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Preview

   Splines now support foam. Please see :ref:`wave-splines-section` for general spline information.

Crest supports inputing any foam into the system, which can be helpful for fine tuning where foam is placed.
To place foam, add some geometry into the world at the area where foam should be added.
Then assign the *RegisterFoamInput* script which will tag it for rendering into the shape, and apply a material with a shader of type *Crest/Inputs/Foam/...*.
See the *DepositFoamTex* object in the *whirlpool.unity* scene for an example.

The process for adding inputs is demonstrated in this :numref:`adding-inputs-video`.

The following input shaders are provided under *Crest/Inputs/Foam*:

-  **Add From Texture** adds foam values read from a user provided texture.
   Can be useful for placing 'blobs' of foam as desired, or canbe moved around at runtime to paint foam into the sim.

-  **Add From Vert Colours** can be applied to geometry and uses the red channel of vertex colours to add foam to the sim.
   Similar in purpose to *Add From Texture*, but can be authored in a modelling workflow instead of requiring at texture.

-  **Override Foam** sets the foam to the provided value.
   Useful for removing foam from unwanted areas.


Simulation Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Foam Fade Rate** - How quickly foam dissipates.
   Low values mean foam remains on surface for longer.
   This setting should be balanced with the generation *strength* parameters below.


Wave foam / whitecaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crest detects where waves are 'pinched' and deposits foam to approximate whitecaps.

-  **Wave Foam Strength** - Scales intensity of foam generated from waves.
   This setting should be balanced with the *Foam Fade Rate* setting.

-  **Wave Foam Coverage** - How much of the waves generate foam.
   Higher values will lower the threshold for foam generation, giving a larger area.


Shoreline foam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If water depth input is provided to the system (see **Sea Floor Depth** section below), the foam sim can automatically generate foam when water is very shallow, which can approximate accumulation of foam at shorelines.

-  **Shoreline Foam Max Depth** - Foam will be generated in water shallower than this depth.
   Controls how wide the band of foam at the shoreline will be.
   Note that this is not a distance to shoreline, but a threshold on water depth, so the width of the foam band can vary
   based on terrain slope.
   To address this limitation we allow foam to be manually added from geometry or from a texture, see the next
   section.

-  **Shoreline Foam Strength** - Scales intensity of foam generated in shallow water.
   This setting should be balanced with the *Foam Fade Rate* setting.


Developer Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings should generally be left unchanged unless one is experiencing issues.

-  **Simulation Frequency** - Frequency to run the foam sim, in updates per second.
   Lower frequencies can be more efficient but may lead to visible jitter.
   Default is 30 updates per second.


.. _sea-floor-depth-section:

Sea Floor Depth
---------------

This simulation stores water depth information.
This is useful information for the system; it is used to attenuate large waves in
shallow water, to generate foam near shorelines, and to provide shallow water shading.
It is calculated by rendering the render geometry in the scene for each LOD from a top down perspective and recording the Y value of the surface.

The following will contribute to ocean depth:

-  Objects that have the *RegisterSeaFloorDepthInput* component attached.
   These objects will render every frame.
   This is useful for any dynamically moving surfaces that need to generate shoreline foam, etcetera.

-  It is also possible to place world space depth caches.
   The scene objects will be rendered into this cache once, and the results saved.
   Once the cache is populated it is then copied into the Sea Floor Depth LOD Data.
   The cache has a gizmo that represents the extents of the cache (white outline) and the near plane of the camera that renders the depth (translucent rectangle).
   The cache should be placed at sea level and rotated/scaled to encapsulate the terrain.

When the water is e.g. 250m deep, this will start to dampen 500m wavelengths, so it is recommended that the sea floor drop down to around this depth away from islands so that there is a smooth transition between shallow and deep water without a visible boundary.

.. _clip-surface-section:

Clip Surface
------------

.. youtube:: jXphUy__J0o

   Water Bodies and Surface Clipping

This data drives clipping of the ocean surface, as in carving out holes.
This can be useful for hollow vessels or low terrain that goes below sea level.
Data can come from geometry (convex hulls) or a texture.

To turn on this feature, enable the *Create Clip Surface Data* option on the *OceanRenderer* script, and ensure the *Enable* option is ticked in the *Clip Surface* group on the ocean material.

The data contains 0-1 values. Holes are carved into the surface when the values is greater than 0.5.

Overlapping meshes will not work correctly in all cases.
There will be cases where one mesh will overwrite another resulting in ocean surface appearing where it should not.
Overlapping boxes aligned on the axes will work well whilst spheres may have issues.

Clip areas can be added by adding geometry that covers the desired hole area to the scene and then assigning the *RegisterClipSurfaceInput* script.
See the *FloatingOpenContainer* object in the *boat.unity* scene for an example usage.

To use other available shaders like *ClipSurfaceRemoveArea* or *ClipSurfaceRemoveAreaTexture*: create a material, assign to renderer and disable *Assign Clip Surface Material* option.
For the *ClipSurfaceRemoveArea* shaders, the geometry should be added from a top down perspective and the faces pointing upwards.


.. _shadows-section:

Shadows
-------

The shadow data consists of two channels.
One is for normal shadows (hard shadow term) as would be used to block specular reflection of the light.
The other is a much softer shadowing value (soft shadow term) that can approximately variation in light scattering in the water volume.

This data is captured from the shadow maps Unity renders before the transparent pass.
These shadow maps are always rendered in front of the viewer.
The Shadow LOD Data then reads these shadow maps and copies shadow information into its LOD textures.

   .. tab:: `HDRP`

      .. include:: includes/_hdrp-shadows.rst

.. only:: urp

   .. tab:: `URP`

      .. include:: includes/_urp-shadows.rst

The shadow sim can be configured by assigning a Shadow Sim Settings asset to the OceanRenderer script in your scene (*Create/Crest/Shadow Sim Settings*).
In particular, the soft shadows are very soft by default, and may not appear for small/thin shadow casters.
This can be configured using the *Jitter Diameter Soft* setting.

There will be times when the shadow jitter settings will cause shadows or light to leak.
An example of this is when trying to create a dark room during daylight.
At the edges of the room the jittering will cause the ocean on the inside of the room (shadowed) to sample outside of the room (not shadowed) resulting in light at the edges.
Reducing the *Jitter Diameter Soft* setting can solve this, but we have also provided a *Register Shadow Input* component which can override the shadow data.
This component bypasses jittering and gives you full control.

.. Note: RP should allow sampling the shadow maps directly in the ocean shader which would be an alternative to using this shadow data, although it would not give the softer shadow component. This would likely work on 2018.

.. _flow-section:

Flow
----

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Flow is the horizontal motion of the water volumes.
It is used in the *whirlpool.unity* example scene to rotate the waves and foam around the vortex.
It does not affect wave directions, but transports the waves horizontally.
This horizontal motion also affects physics.

User Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Preview

   Splines now support flow. Please see :ref:`wave-splines-section` for general spline information.

Crest supports adding any flow velocities to the system.
To add flow, add some geometry into the world which when rendered from a top down perspective will draw the desired displacements.
Then assign the *RegisterFlowInput* script which will tag it for rendering into the flow, and apply a material using one of the following shaders.

The following input shaders are provided under *Crest/Inputs/Flow*:

The *Crest/Inputs/Flow/Add Flow Map* shader writes a flow texture into the system.
It assumes the x component of the flow velocity is packed into 0-1 range in the red channel, and the z component of the velocity is packed into 0-1 range in the green channel.
The shader reads the values, subtracts 0.5, and multiplies them by the provided scale value on the shader.
The process of adding ocean inputs is demonstrated in :numref:`adding-inputs-video`.
