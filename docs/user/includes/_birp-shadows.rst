.. admonition:: Bug

   Shadows are not supported using Deferred Lighting. Please see :issue:`198` for a workaround.

To turn on this feature, enable the *Create Shadow Data* option on the *OceanRenderer* script, and ensure the *Shadowing* option is ticked on the ocean material.

.. TODO: This could be expanded to check required shadow settings.
